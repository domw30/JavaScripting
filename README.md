# JavaScripting

I have used this workshop to help me learn some of the basic concepts of JavaScript by adventuring around in the terminal.

I have pushed the completed challenges to this repository.  

### To use

Clone this repository https://github.com/workshopper/javascripting from workshopper GitHub page.

### Install Node.js

Make sure Node.js is installed on your computer.

Install it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)

On Windows and using v4 or v5 of Node.js? Make sure you are using at least 5.1.0, which provides a fix for a bug on Windows where you can't choose items in the menu.

### Install `javascripting` with `npm`

Open your terminal and run this command:

```
npm install --global javascripting
```

The `--global` option installs this module globally so that you can run it as a command in your terminal.

## Run the workshop

Open your terminal and run the following command:

```
javascripting
```

You'll see the menu:

Navigate the menu with the up & down arrow keys.

Choose a challenge by hitting enter.
